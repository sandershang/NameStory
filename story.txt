Once upon a time, there lived a small boy, named Peanut, in a village far far away. Peanut was the prince in the village. His dad had passed away when he was an infant. Peanut was the smallest boy and the weakest of the village. No matter how much he ate, he didn't grow.  

So peanut packed up shop and left the village. He didn't know where he was heading or where he would end up, but he knew one thing. It was bulking season and it was time for him to make some gains. He headed North.

Peanut lugged his backpack full of protein powder for many miles. Finally, he reached the foot of Mt. Brolympus, home of the venerable gains god Brodin. After a long trek, he reached the summit. There was Brodin, reclining in a golden throne, surrounded by the finest workout equipment in the universe and more whey protein than Peanut had ever seen. Peanut called out, "Mighty Brodin! How can I get huge?" Brodin responded, "My son. Do you even lift?" Inspired, Peanut began the trek home.
