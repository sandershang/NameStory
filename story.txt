Once upon a time, there lived a small boy, named Peanut, in a village far far away. Peanut was the prince in the village. His dad had passed away when he was an infant. Peanut was the smallest boy and the weakest of the village. No matter how much he ate, he didn't grow.  

So peanut packed up shop and left the village. He didn't know where he was heading or where he would end up, but he knew one thing. It was bulking season and it was time for him to make some gains. He headed North.
